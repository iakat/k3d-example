# k3d-juice-shop

This was an interview task I've done in a few hours. 

You can find the [original assignment document here](./original_assignment.pdf)

This was tested on WSL 2 Ubuntu 20.04, and Arch.

## Tools used
- k3d + docker-compose for the cluster
- nginx-ingress with modsecurity enabled
- helm for [templating](manifests/bases/juice-shop/_update.sh) the juice-shop chart
- kustomize for applying it, along with all the other cluster services
- cert-manager and external-dns-operator for DNS and TLS, respectively
- Make to quickly run a bunch of commands

## Deploy

### Local requirements

- docker-compose 3+
- [kustomize](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/master/hack/install_kustomize.sh) (the built-in kubectl version is old)
- port 80 + 443 unused
    
### Deploying

`make` ðŸ˜Ž
(if you want to see what it does, do look at the Makefile, it's quite simple.) 

### Accessing
